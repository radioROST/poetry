I dont see a thread of feelings.
Sure! As our feelings is without wire.
Moment of synchrony our feelings not forgotten.
Moment when the spark turned into fire.

You was tenderness with fairy hair
You smiled when i caresed of you
We with our feelings climbed the stair
Now when i smile you smile too.
